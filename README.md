# 3DPAT_DGD

This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication:
Hauptmann et al., Model based learning for accelerated, limited-view 3D 
photoacoustic tomography,  IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2018.
https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2820382, 

Scripts need Matlab, k-wave toolbox, Python, and tensorflow

Note: Codes are complete for DGD. Network phantom data for simulated test cases added.

- 19 January 2018: First commit
- 29 January 2018: k-wave wrapper added and evaluation of model
- 20 March 2018: network data (DGD) and simulated phantoms added
