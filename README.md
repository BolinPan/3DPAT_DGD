# 3DPAT_DGD

This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication:
Hauptmann et al., Model based learning for accelerated, limited-view 3D 
photoacoustic tomography, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09832

Scripts need Matlab, k-wave toolbox, Python, and tensorflow

Note: Codes are complete, but data is missing
